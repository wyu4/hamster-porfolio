                            weights an ounce. Although most of them don't particularly enjoy being around humans, they
                            tend to get along with other Robos.

                        <p>
                            The Syrian hamster (sometimes known as the Golden hamster) is the largest and most common
                            breed of hamster in the household. Syrians can weigh nearly five times as much as any other
                            breed. Their size makes them easier to handle, which makes Syrians better suited for new
                            hamster owners. However, Syrians are much more territorial, meaning they should be kept
                            alone rather than with other hamsters.

                        <p>
                            The Winter white dwarf hamster (also known as the Russian dwarf hamster) are way smaller
                            than Syrian hamsters, but they make up for it by being super friendly and easy to tame.
                            They're pretty smart too â€” their fur changes from a light gray or brown to white in the
                            winter so they can blend in with the snow. They usually weigh less than two ounces.
                            Plus, they're really chill with both people and other winter white hamsters, which makes
                            them a top pick for both newbie and experienced hamster owners.

                            The Chinese hamster might be small, but it definitely stand out with their super cute long
                            tails and a black stripe running down their backs. Just like other hamsters, they're pretty
                            chill and don't need a ton of maintenance. Even though they're tiny, they still need a
                            spacious setup and lots of chew toys to keep their teeth and little legs in good shape.

                            If your hamster grows accustomed to you, you could also take them out of the enclosure and
                            put them in a hamster-safe room for free-roaming.
